BlackOut is an encrypted messenger for iPads.

It uses the Tox Protocol to encrypt messages between peers. This allows safety and blocks out snooping by using NaCL based encryption.

You can add users by getting their 76-bit Public Key (With NOSPAM and CheckSum) and talk to them in complete safety.
